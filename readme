Backend 1+

Requirements:
PHP 5.3+
DomDocument
file_get_contents - to load file (curl can be used)
nginx, apache

Usage:
1. web - main.php use it
2. console

file uwc i is core of the system, some methods have description
Parser - parse layer we can change dependencies (now its not supported because we have no variants)
cssSemantic - compare css files
RegExMap - Build selector list over Regex - nice but is slower, so deprecated
DomMap - Build selector map by DomDocument, somehow its faster and lighter then regExp case
Search - compare css on page (subclasses not used, its the way to improve)
FileLoad - just loads file content, one place to override

not using interfaces no reason to use if no need to scale.

PS sorry for poor description, i hope you can easily make it work
